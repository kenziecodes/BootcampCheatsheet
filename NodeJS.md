# NodeJS
node can run outside of a browser

to run in terminal you just type 
node filename.js

npm install axios

if you do not have package JSON 
npm init -y

NPM = mode package manager

package JSON they are used a lot they are used to store commands 
it has a lot of functionality 

so much information is stores in the node modules we do not want to push it to github 

brand new node project steps
npm init - y
this builds my package JSON
npm install weather-js 
will add it to our 

????? i always miss everyting 
JSON.stringify prevents [object object]
this wil take that object and turn it to a string

```
var fs = require("fs");
```

when you clone a ne file down and you dont have all the demendencies yyou run npm-install too get them all downloaded

yoou need to use process.argv[] 



## downloading Axios

npm install axiois
touch app.js

```
const axios = require("axios");
let artist = process.argv[2];
axios.get("https://nbivwoibewo/ + artist + /nfkownvvnrwuovruji")
